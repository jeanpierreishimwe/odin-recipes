   <h1>This is a really quick and easy pasta salad. Great for picnics and BBQ's.</h1>
   <p>Pasta salad is a staple for any picnic or outdoor gathering. This is an easy salad to prepare and share with friends and family, going with just about anything on your menu. Keep it cool with fresh cold cucumbers. I usually add olives to my pasta salad for a salty, briny bite.</p>
   <p>This recipe is a kinda blueprint for whatever you can imagine your pasta salad to be. Honestly I think Italian dressing no matter how fancy will make this pasta boring and bland.</p>
  <h1>Ingredients</h1>

   <li>1 (16 ounce) package tri-colored pasta assortment</li>
